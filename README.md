What is Tak?
=============
To win a game of TAK, a player must be the first to create a “road” of stones connecting opposite sides of the board.
Depending on the size of the game, players may also have capstones, which can can come in many decorative shapes. Capstones serve as both a flat stone and a wall, and can also flatten standing walls.[1](http://cheapass.com/tak/)
